# Frontier_Forging  
    
    
  Frontier Forging began in March of 2016 when we found a video on Youtube that showed us how to melt bullet casings and cast them into brass knuckles. We spent countless days sitting in our Honors English class, brainstorming and spit-balling on how we could create our own forge. When we started, we pooled together sixty dollars and drove up to Lowes. Our first forge was made out of a steel bucket, sand, concrete,  a hair dryer, and loads of duct-tape. We put it in the backyard, and completely failed. Our problem was the forge didn't get enough heat to melt the metal. Even though our first attempt was a failure, we persevered, and tried again. This next time we had made molten aluminum, and we were NOT prepared for this at all. We walked away from the forge that day with one burnt hand, 2 pairs of ruined jeans, and huge smiles on our faces. After Christmas, we got a MASSIVE upgrade. Instead of our crummy bucket forge, we got a brand new propane gas forge, an anvil, and a hammer set. With these new things, we now had the tools to create bigger and better  things. Our hobby of blacksmithing has turned into a passion, and we love sharing that passion with others.
    
    
   Our website started as a single HTML document with a gray background and a big red h1 tag that read "Frontier Forging" across the center. It looked awful, and we both knew it. We were stuck for a while, because we both had a love for what we were trying to do, but we also had a hate for TeamTreehouse. Sitting through video after video and answering 5 questions at the end left us bored and frustrated; so we learned to self-teach. As we were avoiding Treehouse at all costs we had to find other ways to learn. We used W3 schools, but what helped us learn the most was talking to other people. We asked lots and lots of questions. Eventually we were able to find our own way.
    
    
    The first thing we started on was our home page. We didn't want to use a hexadecimal color so we began looking for a background image. We didn't want anything too industrial nor too primitive.  We settled on our current background image because it shows something we love to do and it also fit our ideal color scheme. We picked a dark gray and red/orange color scheme for our home screen because it represents the two most important things to our business, metal and fire. 
    
    
    For our store page we wanted a way that our customers could easily contact us. After trying HTML and PHP forms, we weren't happy with the end product. What we ended up using is a form service called formspree. Formspree allows consumers to quickly give us feedback and place orders. Those orders go directly to the Frontier Forging email where we can respond to them. In our store we included a diverse set of items. We also added a custom order page so that the customer could get exactly what they want. In the future, we hope to add more items and expand the store.
    
     Aside from our store page we wanted a page dedicated to showing off our workflow, equipment, and creations. This we called our gallery. Right now we have 8 images and videos posted, the videos we have posted are linked to our Youtube page. We arranged our images and videos in a hopscotch pattern, with one video centered under every two images. We set it up in that way so you can view more than one image at a time without as much scrolling down the page. We have TONS of more content, but for the sake of time, it all wasn't put on our gallery page. 
    
    One thing we really enjoy doing is connecting with new people. We've created a contact page so people can find our different social media accounts see what we're up to, and interact with us. Our favorite ways to connect with others is instagram live videos. These live streams allow people to learn about what we're doing and have a good time with us. The contact page was the first page we made a middle runner for the body content. We did this by giving the body a background color, centering it, and changing the dimensions.
    
  Our About Us page was kept simple. We didn't want to overwhelm people with a novel about everything we've ever done, so we included the Frontier Forging logo, our photos, and our business statement. In the future we want to link our pictures to our own portfolios. 
    
  From a charcoal powered bucket in the backyard, to a steel propane-fueled forge in our own workshop, we have grown a lot. In a year we have learned about what works and what doesn't, we've learned new techniques and refined old ones to fit our passion. We've made good connections, good knives, and met some good people. There is still a lot of room to improve in every aspect of our business, but we hope that our progress so far, all expressed into 8,367 lines of code, will impress you enough to put us on a plane to San Francisco.
